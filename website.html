<p style="text-align: justify;">Subway Sprinters is the ultimate endless running game for your vr headset. Run as far as possible to escape from the police. The longer you run, the faster you become. On the way, avoid the trains and buses by changing lanes. Duck and move your head to avoid wooden crates on your current lane. You can also jump by pulling your arms up quickly. With the help of wooden ladders, you can run on the roofs of the trains. Collect as many coins and diamonds as possible to upgrade your power ups. Use shields to protect yourself from colliding with an obstacle.</p>
