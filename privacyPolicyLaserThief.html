  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  
  <p>Lukas Will built the <strong>Laser Thief</strong> app as a commercial app. This service is provided by Lukas Will and is intended for use as is.</p>

  <p>This page is meant to inform visitors of my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information for anyone who chooses to use my service.</p>
